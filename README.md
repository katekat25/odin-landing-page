# odin-landing-page

I had lots of fun with this project. I am now quite comfortable styling items in CSS as well as utilizing flexbox to create a variety of visually interesting page layouts that fit different screens (except for mobile, but we'll get to that...). I'm having a lot of fun and looking forward to making more of my own webpages! Thanks for peeking at my code. ^_^
